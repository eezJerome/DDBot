**i ripped the code from NLP: Zero to Hero tutorial by Tensorflow because i'm a terrible human being.
all credits go to their rightful owners whom i didn't list here
**
using python with tensorflow.keras to create model, trained on 75 epochs to about 87% accuracy

**In the event that the lyrics are not writing to your file, simply open lyrics file in notepad, save as another file, and change encoding to ANSI. This fixed any issues when the model could not read the text file**

not sure how to wrap this or whatever to discord; probably use JS which is zeke's forte

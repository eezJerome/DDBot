Discord Drake Bot - an attempt at using RNNs and LSTMs for rapping bots

i ripped the code from NLP: Zero to Hero tutorial by Tensorflow because i'm a terrible human being.

using python with tensorflow.keras to create model, trained on 75 epochs to about 87% accuracy

not sure how to wrap this or whatever to discord; probably use JS which is zeke's forte

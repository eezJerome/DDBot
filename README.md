Discord Drake Bot - an attempt at using RNNs and LSTMs for rapping bots

link to h5 file with saved model and weights trained on songs like 50 songs of kanye, drake, and anderson paak (i think...)

i ripped the code from NLP: Zero to Hero tutorial by Tensorflow because i'm a terrible human being.

using python with tensorflow.keras to create model, trained on 75 epochs to about 87% accuracy

not sure how to wrap this or whatever to discord; probably use JS which is zeke's forte
